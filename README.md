# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is about identifying positive or negative tweet for a given set of train and test datasets using natural language toolkit(nltk).

The **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm is a Bayesian learning approach popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The program guesses the tag of a text, such as an email or a newspaper story, using the Bayes theorem. It calculates each tag's likelihood for a given sample and outputs the tag with the greatest chance.
